# How to facilitate this Kata

## Before

Announce the plan : we're going to learn how to use mocks by writing
some of them ourselves, and only afterwards use a library.

Empahisize the fact that the first goal is *not* to fix the bugs, it's
to write a failing test first!

## During

* Let the participants choose a language
* Make them clone this repository (on the `main` branch) and open the correct subfolder in their IDE
* Follow the instructions in the README with the group

## After

Ask:

* When should you use this?
* Do you prefer the hand-written version or using the library ? (no bad answer here)


Note:

Feel free to *name* the various test classes you've written (by using
words like "fake", "spy", "dummy", etc.) - but in my opinion it's better
that particpants remember the various *test strategies* rather than the
definitions.
